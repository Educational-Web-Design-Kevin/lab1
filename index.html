        <p>
            Hello, I am Kevin Alexis Aguilar and I am 20 years old and in my 3rd year (junior) on IIT. I am honesty skeptical of my ability to
            be successful after college because I am book smart but I am definetely not street smart. Half of the time, I really don't how I am
            going to apply IT concepts in the work place considering my botch attempts in ITM 100. But I rather try to get the hang of this 
            because it's way worse giving up. However, I really like programming, especially in JAVA, HTML, and CSS. I am also a co-terminal
            student which it isn't that bad for my schedule because I took early college credit classes at Sarah E. Goode (highschool). If it
            wasn't for that master's degree, this would have been my last year at IIT, but hey, at least I can get a better chance of getting
            a job with a really good wage.
        </p>
